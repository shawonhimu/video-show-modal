# Video Show Hide Modal Using Bootstrap-5

First of all, I face the problem that a pop-up video is opened but when i close the modal it still playing the video in background and so the video sound is running. To solve this problem i use only javascript.

You might know that this problem is solved using JQuery in previous version of Bootstarp (Bootstrap-4).
But Bootstrap-5 has no dependency with JQuery.
So sometimes you may face problem with a little bit with this if you have less practise.
This for kind of people that may be helpful.
